* LUM - Linux Ubiquitous Marker
This project was created for two main reasons: I wanted to mess a little bit with Rust and I wanted to have bookmarks outside the Web Browser.
I plan to integrate Lum to other programs such as rofi/wofi, Emacs etc.

** Installation
I'm not shipping any binaries right now, so you will need to clone this repo and build locally:
=git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:henrique-marques-vsoft/lum.git=
=cd lum=
=cargo build=
=cargo run -h=

** Options
=lum -g= to generate the structured file;  
=lum -h= ask for help;
=lum -l= list all bookmarks;
=lum -a= add a new bookmark entry;
=lum -d= delete a bookmark;

Bookmarks everywhere!
