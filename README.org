* lum

Lum Universal Marker.

** Usage

Although it is not really necessary to run this program, having `fzf` and `xclip` would be great if you want to integrate with other programs.
A pretty useful command to fetch your bookmarks would be:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
~$ lum -l | fzf | xclip -selection clipboard
#+END_SRC

*** For Guix Users
You can use the =manifest.scm= file to get a shell with all the dependencies you will need to run this project:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
~$ guix shell --manifest=manifest.scm
~$ lein run -- -g
#+END_SRC

*** For Emacs Users
In Emacs, you can define a quick command to search and copy your bookmarks:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun my-consult-bookmark ()
    "Select a bookmark using `completing-read` and copy it to the clipboard."
    (interactive)
    (let* ((candidates (split-string (shell-command-to-string "java -jar ~/path/to/lum/target/uberjar/lum-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar -l") "\n" t))
	   (selection (completing-read "Select bookmark: " candidates)))
      (when selection
	(kill-new selection)
	(message "Copied to clipboard: %s" selection))))

(global-set-key (kbd "C-c b") 'my-consult-bookmark)
#+END_SRC

Note that you must fix the =~/path/to/lum=.
