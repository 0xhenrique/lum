# lum

Lum Universal Marker.

## Usage

Although it is not really necessary to run this program, having `fzf` and `xclip` would be great if you want to integrate with other programs.
A pretty useful command to fetch your bookmarks would be:
```
user@user ~$ lum -l | fzf | xclip -selection clipboard
```
